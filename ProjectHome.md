Generic Default's Combat (GDC) is a modification of GCX to make Gmod war better. It's basically just new sounds, effects, and awesomeness in general. Check out a folder to this link;

http://generic-defaults-combat.googlecode.com/svn/gdc

You no longer need Gcombat core for this to work.

More news!
The main GDC SVN has been relocated (branched) so that GDCW SWEPS could be accommodated.
This will not affect content; all you have to do is switch over to the new link. To do this, right click on your folder, then;
Tortoise SVN -> Relocate -> (put new link here)
It should take about 30 seconds.

Here are the new links

http://generic-defaults-combat.googlecode.com/svn/gdc/            <----- ORIGINAL, RELOCATED

http://generic-defaults-combat.googlecode.com/svn/gdcw/           <----- FOR SWEPS

http://generic-defaults-combat.googlecode.com/svn/gdcss/           <----- FOR CSS SWEPS

A recent Gmod update broke scripted sounds for all addons. It is NOT a problem with GDC. Garry should fix it eventually, but until then there is nothing I can do. If you want to fix it for yourself, do these 5 steps;

1) Go to scripts/sounds folder in this addon.
2) Copy the two files
3) Go to the garrysmod/garrysmod/scripts/sounds folder
4) Paste them in there
5) Start Gmod. The sounds should work
